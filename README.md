# STOR-601-c-Coursework

#### TASK 1

IS_STABLE.h is the header file for the IS_STABLE algorithm, and IS_STABLE.cpp is the source code file for the algorithm. These can be compiled in Unix to give the object file, called IS_STABLE.o .
This is done by using the following code:
g++ --version
g++ --std=c++17 -c IS_STABLE.cpp           // This compiles the object file
ls *.o                                     // This shows that the file IS_STABLE.o has been produced


Fundamental.h is the header file for the Fundamental Algorithm, and Fundamental.cpp is the source code file for the algorithm. These can be compiled in Unix to give the object file, called Fundamental.o .
This is done by using the following code:
g++ --version
g++ --std=c++17 -c Fundamental.cpp           // This compiles the object file
ls *.o                                     // This shows that the file Fundamental.o has been produced
