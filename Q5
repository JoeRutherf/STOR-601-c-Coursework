One way that you an use c++ on Windows is via Code::Blocks, which can be used for free.

1) Go to the webpage https://sourceforge.net/projects/codeblocks/files/latest/download and press the button download.
2) After downloading it, load it up by accessing your downloads.
3) After loading it up, it gives a blank c++ file, in whih you can make files, such as .cpp ones.
An advantage to using Code::Blocks is that instead of partitioning the code into different blocks like you do in Jupyter lab, you can leave the code in one section.
